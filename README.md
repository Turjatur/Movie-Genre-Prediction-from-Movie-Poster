# Movie-Genre-Prediction-from-Movie-Poster

Can machine learning algorithms classify genres of movies by looking at the poster?

A movie can belong to more than one genre. It doesnâ€™t just have to belong to one category, like action or comedy. The movie can be a combination of two or more genres. Hence, multi-label image classification. This dataset contains the poster images of several multi-genre movies.
